# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis-Python
📌 Project Overview
This project performs Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis on a transactional retail dataset.
RFM is a behavioral segmentation technique used to identify high-value customers based on:
Recency (R) – How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency (F) – How often a customer purchases
Monetary (M) – How much a customer spends
The goal is to classify customers into actionable segments such as:
1.Champions
2.Loyal Customers
3.Potential Loyalists
4.At Risk
5.Lost
6.New Customers
